OpenCRG
=======

[OpenCRG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCRG) is a library and file format
used to describe road surfaces, enabling applications such as simulation of
tires and vibrations during driving.


This Repository
===============

This repository contains the C API found in the subdirectory `c-api/baselib`
of all releases previously published on [opencrg.org](http://opencrg.org/)
and available through
[web.archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/*/opencrg.org) or sourced by
other means, i.e. some versions in the range from 1.0.2 to 1.1.2.

Due to unclear licensing, the current release 1.2.0 is not available here.
However, it may be obtained from another public
[git repository](https://code.asam.net/simulation/standard/asam-opencrg.git).


Building OpenCRG C API
======================

Either use `make` and install the haeders and resulting archive library
manually or use [Spack](https://spack.io/) together with the
[HLRS Vis Spack Repository](https://github.com/hlrs-vis/spack-hlrs-vis).
